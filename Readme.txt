1. All you need to follow along with this presentation is Python3
   and the Pygame module.

2. You can download Pygame via its website http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
   or through "pip".
	
	2a) for installation via pip go to your command line and simply type
	    "pip install Pygame" and you'll be good to go.

3. I'll be demonstrating a program with a display size of 1000px by 600px.
   I have provided images, if you'd like to setup the program with your own
   you're more than welcome and I encourage all to do so. Just make sure they fit
   the parameters and have the provided images DL'd incase something doesn't work.
